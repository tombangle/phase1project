The Story Behind My Application
The idea for this application stems from when we first moved onto our property seven years ago. It was a hectic time—our business was just beginning to take off, and life was full of challenges. My wife, being the meticulous planner that she is, was firm about sticking to a budget and planned weekly grocery trips. Each week, she would ask my son and me what meals we wanted for dinner. Without fail, our answer was always, "We don’t know."
I can only imagine how frustrating it must have been for her to not only handle the grocery planning but also decide on meals and cook for us. Meanwhile, we "kitchen-challenged" boys were of no help. After weeks of this, I started thinking about how much easier it would be if an app could generate meal plans and recipes automatically. That’s where the inspiration for this application began.
